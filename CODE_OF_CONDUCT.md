# This is the Gogh Code of Conduct
This is mostly built on top of the [Ferus Project's](https://github.com/ferus-web) code of conduct. \
You needn't read a huge document, here's everything:
- Don't be racist.
- Don't be sexist.
- Don't harass people and respect their boundaries.
- Don't be a generally unlikeable person.

That's it.
